## Welcome to my personal webpage

I'm a PhD student in numerical analysis and computational physics at Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrtron DESY and Universit√§t Hamburg. In my short academic career I've had a wide range of scientific interests ranging from control theory and machine learning to partial differential equations and theories of generalized functions. And my current research seems to have ended up being rather interdisciplinary. This website summarizes my research and tries to give some space to ideas that, otherwise, may end up undiscussed.
