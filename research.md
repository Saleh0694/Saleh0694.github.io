A summary of my research.

# Research description 
In my PhD I'm working on developping numerical methods to allow for simulating laser interactions with weakly-bound molecules. In particular, the project involved developping active machine learning frameworks to model potential-energy surfaces of molecules. Current resesrch focuses on developping neural network-augmented spectral methods for predicting eigenvalues of molecules. These projects reside at the intersection between numerical analysis, machine learning and molecular physics.
